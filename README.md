# ReactJs

# Data should not be fetch in the render method. We should just return the ui components in the render method. We couldn't make any HTTP calls in render method. so render() is use for just showing the ui elements. 

# we can make ajax calls in React using life cycle events. 

# Lifecycle methods are bounded specially methods in component. These methods are automatically bounded to component instance. 

# componentWillMount(): invoked immediately  before the component instered into the DOM
# componentDidMount(): invoked immediately after the component instered into the DOM.
# componentWillUnmount() invoked immediately before the component removed from DOM.
# componentWillReceiveProps(): invoked whenever the component is about to receive new brand props.
